First, let's look at the PDB statistics:

```{r}
tbl<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
```

##Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
n.type <- colSums(tbl)
percentages<- (n.type/n.type["Total"] * 100)
ans<- signif(percentages, 3)
ans

```

The proportion of Xray sructures is `r ans[1]` % of the total The proportion of NMR sructures is `r ans[2]` % of the total

##Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
ans2<- signif(tbl$Total[1]/ sum (tbl$Total),3) * 100
ans2
```

`r ans2` % of the structures are protein

##Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

It varies quite a lot depending on our search methodology, but generally several hundred structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb<- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
aa321(c("PRO", "GLN"))
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```


Lets read a different single adk structure from the database now:


```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```


Let's find related sequences with BLAST:
```{r}
blast<- blast.pdb(aa)
```


```{r}
hits<-plot(blast)
```
```{r}

hits$pdb.id
```


Now let's find an alpha fold prediction for a protein homologous to our unknown gene:
